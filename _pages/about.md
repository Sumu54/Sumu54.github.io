<p align="justify">
I am a molecular biologist with a Ph.D. in Biochemistry from the <a href="https://biochem.iisc.ac.in/sathees-c-raghavan.php" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Science</a>, where I worked under the guidance of <a href="https://satheesscrlab10.wixsite.com/website" target="_blank">Prof. Sathees C. Raghavan</a>. My doctoral work focused on the mechanisms of double-strand break repair and genome fragility in mammalian mitochondria.

Currently, I am a Research Associate at the <a href="https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski/labs/members/sumedha-dahal" target="_blank">Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</a> in New York, in the laboratory of <a href="https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski/labs/dirk-remus" target="_blank">Dr. Dirk Remus</a>. My postdoctoral research involves dissecting the biochemical and structural basis of DNA replication and genome maintenance.

My research expertise spans gene cloning, protein purification, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and advanced biochemical assays for DNA repair and replication. I am particularly passionate about understanding how non-B DNA structures such as G-quadruplexes influence genomic stability and contribute to disease.

I have authored several peer-reviewed publications in journals like <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004219311985" target="_blank">iScience</a>, <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/69916" target="_blank">eLife</a>, <a href="https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/febs.15799" target="_blank">The FEBS Journal</a>, and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925823009347" target="_blank">Journal of Biological Chemistry</a>, and have presented at leading conferences including the ASCB-EMBO Meeting. I aim to bridge fundamental research in genome biology with translational insights into disease mechanisms.
