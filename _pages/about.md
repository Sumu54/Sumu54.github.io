<p align="justify">
I am a molecular biologist with a Ph.D. in Biochemistry and over four years of postdoctoral research experience in genome stability, DNA repair, and mitochondrial biology. Currently, I work as a Research Associate at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, where I focus on the biochemical and structural characterization of DNA-protein interactions involved in genome maintenance.

My research journey began with a Ph.D. at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, where I investigated the mechanisms of double-strand break repair and genome fragility in mammalian mitochondria. Since then, my work has expanded to include chromatin immunoprecipitation, protein purification, replication reconstitution, and mammalian cell culture techniques. I am particularly passionate about exploring how DNA structures like G-quadruplexes influence genome stability.

I have published extensively in high-impact journals including *Cell Molecular Life Sciences*, *The FEBS Journal*, *eLife*, and *Journal of Biological Chemistry*. I also enjoy scientific communication and collaboration, having presented at international conferences such as ASCB-EMBO in San Diego. My long-term goal is to contribute to translational research that connects molecular mechanisms to therapeutic advances in genome biology.
